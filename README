THis is my test Git repo
The files gpio.c and common.h contain source for accessing GPIO PINS of a linux powered board such as Raspberry pi.
We just need to supply the appropriate pin number by looking at the Board SOC's Technical reference manual.

For eg: gpio_direction(int Pin_number, int direction);

Where direction = 1 (IN) , 0 (OUT).
